## Coding Exercises Options


#### The Coding Exercise Options

You can choose from:

* [Editable Profile](./editable_profile/README.md)
* [Filtering Matches](./filtering_matches/README.md)
* [Gallery Images Upload](./gallery_images_upload/README.md)
* [Personality Test](./personality_test/README.md)


#### Some Universal Rules

For _ALL_ the exercises, the following principles apply:

* Supply clean, readable automated testing; definitely unit and potentially integration / client tests
* Clean code (using things like SOLID principles etc)
* Some build / make / run instructions should be included with the code
    * If you use any servers / services please include a deployment script, or setup instructions for them
* Use a git repository and add commits for significant working steps. 
    * Either send your git repo with the code, or push it to github and give us access
